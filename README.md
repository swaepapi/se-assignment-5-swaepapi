   To set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code, follow these steps:

 Step 1: Set Up the Debug Configuration
  **Create a `launch.json` file**: This file is used to configure the debugger. You can create it manually or let VS Code generate it for you.
  **Configure the `launch.json` file**: Specify the debugger type, the program to run, and any additional settings required for your specific debugger.

 Step 2: Set a Breakpoint
 **Open the file**: Open the file containing the code you want to debug.
 **Set a breakpoint**: Click in the margin to the left of the line of code where you want to pause execution.

 Step 3: Start Debugging
  **Start the debugger**: Press `F5` or click the "Start Debugging" button in the Debug Toolbar.
 **Attach the debugger**: The debugger will attach to the running process and pause at the first breakpoint.

 Key Debugging Features in VS Code
 **Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines of code.
 **Stepping**: Step through your code by pressing `F10` to step over a line, `F11` to step into a function, or `Shift + F11` to step out of a function.
 **Watch Expressions**: Monitor the values of variables and expressions during execution.
 **Call Stack**: View the sequence of function calls leading to the current point in the code.
 **Debug Console**: Interactively evaluate expressions and inspect variables.
 **Conditional Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints that only trigger when specific conditions are met.
 **Function Breakpoints**: Break at the beginning of a function instead of a specific line.
